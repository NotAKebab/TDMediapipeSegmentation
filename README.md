# Touchdesigner + Mediapipe Experimentation

This project aims to experiment with the capabilities of TouchDesigner through the use of body segmentation using Google's Mediapipe library.

The use of the Mediapipe component is thanks to the [Open Plugin by Torin Blankensmith](https://github.com/torinmb/mediapipe-touchdesigner).


The idea emerged from attempting to create a bridge between body segmentation and the ability to generate interactive art using TouchDesigner. The initial exploration involved researching the capabilities of both technologies and identifying possible points of integration.


The workflow used for designing this project is based on an interface that connects TD with Mediapipe’s body segmentation to receive data.


##Data Capture and Processing 
Utilization of the Mediapipe library through the plugin to perform real-time body segmentation and extract information related to color and position. TD is used to interpret the data for generative art and interactions between the two components.


##Visual Interaction 
Design of two effects in TouchDesigner that dynamically respond to the user’s movements, poses and interface interactions.
